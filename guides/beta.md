=======
You can access the [PlanHub Beta Channel](http://beta.planhub.me) by going to <http://beta.planhub.me>. The beta channel, also referred to as "staging", contains the latest changes to PlanHub's code, as soon as they are made.  While this means you can test your application with the latest features and API changes, it is also not stable. This is why data is not synchronized between stable and beta. There may be major bugs, errors, or other issues. We don't provide support for beta&mdash;however, if you've found an issue, even if it's in beta, please [tell us](https://github.com/PlanHubMe/PlanHub/issues/new)!

**Warning: Please do not use PlanHub beta as a replacement for normal PlanHub. There may be major errors, long downtime, or other issues. However, we do recommend testing your application against the beta version to ensure that your application will not break when the stable version of PlanHub updates.**
